Numis-o-matic was created for the purposes of HIST 5706: Guerilla Digital Public History. The goal of this project is to challenge dominant and official narratives of Canadian commemorative coins and to re-situate them in narratives that highlight the nuances of the histories they signify. The three coins chosen for this project were minted in the last four years and celebrate major anniversaries that are not as truthful as they appear upon first glance.
